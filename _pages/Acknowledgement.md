This book would not have been possible without the generous support of the National Science Foundation (NSF) grant (# 2321054), which enabled us to explore the intersection of chemistry and data science in depth. We are deeply grateful for their commitment to advancing scientific education and research, including the support of our C2D project.

We also wish to extend our heartfelt thanks to the many students who contributed their time, ideas, and hard work throughout the development of this book. Their valuable input, from testing concepts to providing feedback on practical applications, has greatly enriched the content and made this book more accessible and effective for chemists looking to embrace data-driven approaches. Especially, we are grateful to the following students for their invaluable assistance in collecting training materials, which played a crucial role in shaping the foundation of this book:

- Aidan Finn, C2D REU student, undergraduate student from University of Notre Dame
- Zichu Wang, C2D REU student, undergraduate researcher from Carnegie Mellon University
- Karenna Kung, C-CAS SURF program student, undergraduate researcher from Smith College
- Jordan Letu, C-CAS SURF program student, undergraduate researcher from California State University, Fullerton
- Vivian Quach, C-CAS SURF program student, undergraduate researcher from California State University, Fullerton

Lastly, we welcome any feedback, collaboration, or suggestions from readers and colleagues. Your insights and perspectives are invaluable as we continue to improve and expand the resources available for data-driven chemistry.

Thank you to all who have supported this endeavor. Your contributions have been instrumental to its success.
