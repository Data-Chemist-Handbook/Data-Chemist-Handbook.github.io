In molecular property optimization, the vastness and complexity of chemical space pose a significant challenge. Chemists must navigate a nearly infinite number of possible molecular structures in search of those with the optimal properties. This task requires finding a balance between two key strategies: exploration—searching for entirely new or unexplored molecules that may offer better properties, and exploitation—focusing on refining and improving molecules already known to perform well.
