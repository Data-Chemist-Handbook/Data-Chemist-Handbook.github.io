In modern chemistry, predicting the properties of a molecule before synthesizing it is both a challenge and an opportunity. Experimental testing can be time-consuming, expensive, or even infeasible for large compound libraries. As a result, computational methods have become essential for prioritizing candidates with desired characteristics.

Molecular property prediction focuses on learning the relationship between a molecule’s structure and its physicochemical or biological properties. These properties can range from solubility, toxicity, and permeability to more complex metrics like bioavailability or metabolic stability. The goal is to build models that can accurately predict these properties based on the molecular information available—often in the form of descriptors, fingerprints, or SMILES strings.

Machine learning models are particularly well-suited for this task because they can capture non-linear, high-dimensional relationships between structure and function. Chemists can now leverage a wide array of algorithms to train predictive models using labeled datasets of molecules and their known properties.

This chapter explores how various machine learning techniques—including Recurrent Neural Networks, Graph Neural Networks, Random Forests, and traditional Neural Networks—can be applied to property prediction problems in chemistry. These methods are tested on benchmark datasets such as **BBBP**, which evaluates a compound’s ability to cross the blood–brain barrier.

Whether you’re screening drug candidates, designing safer chemicals, or optimizing synthetic routes, molecular property prediction provides a critical edge. When used effectively, it enables smarter experimentation, reduces waste, and accelerates discovery.

We begin with sequence-based learning using **Recurrent Neural Networks** for SMILES classification.

## 4.1 Recurrent Neural Networks

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of deep learning architecture designed to process sequential data—making them especially powerful for tasks involving temporal order or structural dependencies. In chemistry, this makes RNNs a natural fit for working with **SMILES strings**, a linear representation of molecules that encodes structural information using a sequence of characters.

Unlike traditional feedforward neural networks, which treat each input independently, RNNs maintain a **hidden state** that carries contextual information from one step of the sequence to the next. This allows them to capture dependencies across a molecular structure that are expressed sequentially, such as ring closures or branches that appear far apart in the SMILES string but are chemically related.

---

#### Why Use RNNs for SMILES?

SMILES strings are inherently sequential—they describe atoms and bonds in a specific order. For example:

```
CC(=O)O
```

This string encodes acetic acid: a methyl group (C), a carbonyl (=O), and a hydroxyl (O). To understand or predict molecular properties from this input, a model must consider not just which characters are present, but **how they relate to one another over the course of the sequence**.

RNNs are designed to do exactly that. They process one character at a time while maintaining a memory of previous characters, enabling the model to learn how patterns in molecular syntax relate to the molecule’s function or properties.

---

#### RNN Architecture Basics

An RNN processes a sequence step by step. At each time step *t*, it:

- Receives an input token (e.g. a SMILES character)
- Updates its hidden state based on the current input and the previous hidden state
- Optionally generates an output (e.g. a prediction or classification)

Mathematically:

$$
h_t = f(W \cdot x_t + U \cdot h_{t-1} + b)
$$

Where:

- \( h_t \) is the hidden state at time *t*
- \( x_t \) is the current input
- \( W, U \) are learned weight matrices
- \( b \) is a bias term
- \( f \) is typically a nonlinear activation function (like tanh or ReLU)

Because the model shares parameters across time steps, RNNs can generalize to variable-length sequences—an important property for molecules, which naturally vary in size.

---

#### Practical Variants: LSTM and GRU

Standard RNNs suffer from a problem called **vanishing gradients**, which makes it hard to learn long-range dependencies. To address this, more advanced versions like **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** and **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)** were developed.

These architectures include internal gating mechanisms that control how much past information to retain or forget. In molecular modeling, they can capture subtle long-distance relationships, such as how atoms at opposite ends of a molecule may influence solubility or reactivity.

---

#### What Can RNNs Learn About Molecules?

- **Property Prediction**: RNNs can be trained to classify molecules based on solubility, toxicity, bioavailability, etc., using their SMILES strings as input.
- **Molecule Generation**: Trained RNNs can generate new valid SMILES strings, enabling data-driven de novo molecule design.
- **Reaction Prediction**: When given reactants as input, RNNs can learn to output the likely product SMILES.

These applications rely on the model's ability to learn chemical syntax as a language—very similar to how RNNs are used in natural language processing.

### 4.1.1 BBBP Dataset Classification Using RNNs

**Completed and Compiled Code:** [Click Here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1p04CBncUdBVaSiQDW05AjKXa95mPN5q1?usp=sharing)

To demonstrate how Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) can be used for molecular property prediction, we'll classify molecules from the BBBP dataset based on whether they are likely to cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB). This is a critical consideration in drug design, as compounds that cannot reach the central nervous system are ineffective for neurological targets.

---

#### Problem Statement
Given a molecule’s SMILES string, our task is to predict a binary label:

- `1` if the molecule is BBB-permeable

- `0` otherwise

This is a **sequence classification problem**. We'll use a **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)** model that reads SMILES character-by-character and learns chemical structure patterns over time.

---

#### Dataset Overview
We use the curated BBBP dataset hosted on GitHub:

[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Data-Chemist-Handbook/Data-Chemist-Handbook.github.io/refs/heads/master/_pages/BBBP.csv](url)

The dataset contains:

- A `smiles` column: molecular structure in SMILES format
- A `p_np`   column: binary permeability label (`1` for permeable, `0` for not)

---

#### Example: Classifying Molecules with GRU

This code is designed to run in Google Colab and performs the full classification pipeline:

```python
# Step 1: Install dependencies
!pip install -q rdkit pandas scikit-learn tensorflow

# Step 2: Load the BBBP dataset from GitHub
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Data-Chemist-Handbook/Data-Chemist-Handbook.github.io/refs/heads/master/_pages/BBBP.csv"
data = pd.read_csv(url)

# Step 3: Extract SMILES and labels
smiles_list = data['smiles']
labels = data['p_np']

# Step 4: Tokenize SMILES at character level
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

tokenizer = Tokenizer(char_level=True)
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(smiles_list)
sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(smiles_list)
X = pad_sequences(sequences, padding='post', maxlen=120)
y = labels.values

# Step 5: Train/test split
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 6: Build GRU model
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, GRU, Dense

vocab_size = len(tokenizer.word_index) + 1

model = Sequential()
model.add(Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=32, input_length=120))
model.add(GRU(units=64))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.summary()

# Step 7: Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)

# Step 8: Evaluate performance
loss, acc = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Test Accuracy: {acc:.2f}')
```

---

#### Analysis

This example demonstrates how RNNs can directly process SMILES sequences to learn patterns relevant to pharmacological properties—specifically, blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability. During training:

- The **embedding layer** transforms each character in the SMILES string into a dense vector representation, allowing the network to learn chemical syntax.
- The **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)** processes the sequence of vectors, retaining context across the string and modeling relationships between distant atoms.
- The **final dense layer** outputs a probability estimate indicating whether the molecule is likely to cross the blood–brain barrier.

In this basic configuration, the model achieved around **79% test accuracy** after 5 epochs. While this is a strong baseline, further improvements can be made by:

- Adding **dropout layers** to reduce overfitting
- Increasing the number of **GRU units** or stacking multiple layers
- Using **learning rate schedules** or more advanced optimizers

This reinforces the utility of RNNs for tasks involving molecular structure encoded in sequence form, and highlights the accessibility of SMILES-based deep learning workflows in cheminformatics.

---

#### Key Takeaways
- RNNs are capable of learning meaningful features directly from raw SMILES text.
- Character-level tokenization ensures syntactic fidelity of molecular input.
- GRU models are efficient for learning dependencies in molecular sequences.
- This approach enables rapid screening of drug candidates for CNS activity based on SMILES alone.

### 4.1.2 Understanding How RNNs Interpret Molecular Sequences

**Completed and Compiled Code:** [Click Here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18qXcfimZM0bm1DH1gzKSX9OWTq2TFOyn?usp=sharing)

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), especially their GRU and LSTM variants, are often treated as black boxes. But to truly harness their potential for molecular tasks, it's important to understand how they interpret the input SMILES sequences and build internal representations of molecular features.

---

#### From Characters to Chemistry: What RNNs Actually Learn
Each SMILES string is treated as a sequence of characters—such as `C`, `=`, `O`, `(`, or digits used to indicate ring closures. Initially, these characters are meaningless to the model. However, during training:
- The **embedding layer** transforms each character into a dense vector that captures how frequently it appears with other characters.
- As training progresses, characters like `'C'`, `'O'`, `'N'` begin to take on **chemical context**, because the model sees that certain patterns—such as `'C(=O)O'` (carboxylic acid) or `'N(C)C'` (tertiary amine)—correlate with particular output labels.

Thus, the network gradually learns to interpret chemically relevant **motifs** as sequential patterns.

---

#### Hidden State = Molecular Memory
At every step in a SMILES string, an RNN computes a hidden state vector that summarizes everything it has "seen" so far. This hidden state evolves as the sequence is read character by character.

In our BBBP example:

- Early in the sequence, the model might only have seen `'C'` or `'CC('`.
- As it processes more atoms and branches, it builds a richer internal representation that reflects possible **substructures, functional groups, or steric motifs**.
- When the model reaches the end of the SMILES, it uses its final hidden state to decide if the molecule is likely to be BBB-permeable.

This makes RNNs especially powerful for molecules with **long-range dependencies**, such as ring closures or functional groups connected through non-adjacent atoms.

---

#### Attention Mechanisms

In more advanced architectures, **attention layers** can be added to help the model decide which parts of the SMILES string are most important for making a prediction. While not used in our basic GRU model, attention is widely used in modern molecular sequence models (including Transformers).

---

#### Visualizing Learned Representations (Optional Exploration)
You can visualize what the model is learning using:

- **Embedding heatmaps:** Show which characters are embedded similarly.
- **Hidden state trajectories:** Plot hidden state values as the SMILES is processed to detect “activation spikes” around chemical groups.
- **Saliency maps (advanced):** Highlight which characters in the input had the greatest effect on the model's prediction.

---

#### Practice Problem : Exploring RNN Hidden States
**Instructions**
Use the trained GRU model from 4.1.1 and modify it to return the hidden states of the SMILES sequence `CC(=O)O` (acetic acid). Specifically, extract the hidden state after each character is read to visualize how the model "builds" its chemical understanding step-by-step.

**Expected Learning Outcome**
This exercise will help you understand how RNNs accumulate sequential information and demonstrate that even short molecules result in meaningful internal representations.This exercise will help you understand how RNNs accumulate sequential information and demonstrate that even short molecules result in meaningful internal representations.

**Solution Code:**
```python
# Install dependencies (if needed)
!pip install -q rdkit pandas scikit-learn tensorflow

# Load the BBBP dataset
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Data-Chemist-Handbook/Data-Chemist-Handbook.github.io/refs/heads/master/_pages/BBBP.csv"
data = pd.read_csv(url)

# Tokenize SMILES
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

smiles_list = data['smiles']
tokenizer = Tokenizer(char_level=True)
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(smiles_list)

# Create vocab_size for embedding
vocab_size = len(tokenizer.word_index) + 1
```

Once that’s run, your tokenizer and vocab_size variables will be defined, and then you can safely run your visualization code:

```python
# Your visualization code
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Embedding, GRU
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Prepare test input
test_smiles = ['CC(=O)O']
test_seq = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(test_smiles)
test_pad = pad_sequences(test_seq, padding='post', maxlen=120)

# Define GRU model to return all hidden states
input_layer = Input(shape=(120,))
embed_layer = Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=32)(input_layer)
gru_layer, state_seq = GRU(units=64, return_sequences=True, return_state=True)(embed_layer)

# Build model and predict
intermediate_model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=gru_layer)
hidden_states = intermediate_model.predict(test_pad)

# Plot hidden state activations
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 6))
plt.imshow(hidden_states[0][:len(test_seq[0])], aspect='auto', cmap='viridis')
plt.colorbar()
plt.title("GRU Hidden State Activations for 'CC(=O)O'")
plt.xlabel("Hidden State Dimension")
plt.ylabel("Sequence Position (Character Index)")
plt.xticks(np.arange(0, 64, 8))
plt.yticks(np.arange(len(test_seq[0])), labels=list(test_smiles[0]))
plt.show()
```

---

#### Expected Output
You will see a heatmap where:

- The **x-axis** shows the 64 GRU hidden state dimensions
- The **y-axis****** shows each character in the input SMILES string
- Color intensity shows how active each hidden unit is at each character step

---

#### Interpretation
This visualization offers an intuitive look at what your RNN is doing internally. For example:
- Repeating characters like `'C'` may produce similar activations early on.
- When the model encounters a `'('` or `'='`, you may notice distinct changes in hidden state activity, reflecting structural divergence.
- The character `'O'` at the end (representing a hydroxyl) may trigger stronger activations in certain units—this could correlate with features relevant to solubility or permeability.

---

#### Takeaway
The GRU model doesn’t just memorize chemical strings—it **learns to encode chemistry** in a way that preserves the molecule’s structural logic over time. This exercise demonstrates how sequence-based neural networks build internal representations step-by-step, capturing both local and global features in a molecule.

### 4.1.3 Encoding and Embedding Strategies for SMILES

**Completed and Compiled Code:** [Click Here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19NRosSmfuVg3s9hwDF-lFsgviHe_WcUR?usp=sharing)

When working with SMILES strings in deep learning models, how you represent each character or token can significantly affect model performance. This process—called encoding—translates the textual SMILES sequence into numerical inputs that a neural network can process.

---

#### One-Hot Encoding: Binary Vectors for Each Character

There are two primary strategies:

- **One-hot encoding**
- **Learnable embeddings (dense vector representations)**

In one-hot encoding, each character is represented by a binary vector. For a vocabulary of size *V*, a single character is mapped to a vector of length *V* where only one element is 1 (the index of that character), and the rest are 0.

For example, if your SMILES vocabulary contains `[C, O, N, (, ), =]`, then:

- `'C'` → `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
- `'='` → `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]`

This method is:

- Simple and easy to implement
- Sparse, meaning most of the vector values are zeros
- Memory-intensive, especially for large vocabularies

Most importantly, one-hot vectors treat all characters as equally distinct. `'C'` and `'N'` have no more similarity than `'C'` and `'='`, even though chemically they might share more context.

---

#### Learnable Embeddings: Letting the Model Discover Chemistry

In modern neural networks, we often use an embedding layer instead of one-hot vectors. This layer learns to map each character to a dense, continuous vector of fixed length (e.g., 32 or 64 dimensions) during training.

**Benefits:**

- **Efficient:** Lower-dimensional vectors are less memory-intensive
- **Expressive:** Embeddings can capture chemical relationships between symbols (e.g., `'O'` and `'N'` might end up closer in vector space than `'O'` and `'('`)
- **Trainable:** The network learns to organize the embedding space based on the prediction task (e.g., solubility, toxicity)

In Keras, this is done with:

```python
Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=32)
```

Here, `input_dim` is the total number of SMILES characters, and `output_dim` is the embedding size.

---

#### One-Hot vs. Embedding: Which Should Chemists Use?

| Strategy  | Pros                          | Cons                               |
| --------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| One-hot   | Interpretable, no parameters  | Sparse, doesn't capture similarity |
| Embedding | Compact, learns relationships | Requires more data to train well   |

For most deep learning tasks, **learnable embeddings are preferred**. They allow models to generalize more effectively across chemical space and are standard in cheminformatics applications today.

---

#### Practice Problem: Compare One-Hot vs. Embedding

**Instructions**
Compare model performance using one-hot encoding vs. an embedding layer on a subset of the BBBP dataset:

1. Modify your GRU model from Section 4.1.1 to use one-hot encoded SMILES instead of an embedding layer.
2. Train the model for 5 epochs and note the test accuracy.
3. Repeat using the embedding layer (as done originally).
4. Which method gives better performance? Why?

**Solution Code:**

```python
# Step 1: Install and import dependencies
!pip install -q rdkit pandas scikit-learn tensorflow

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import GRU, Dense

# Step 2: Load the BBBP dataset
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Data-Chemist-Handbook/Data-Chemist-Handbook.github.io/refs/heads/master/_pages/BBBP.csv"
data = pd.read_csv(url)

smiles_list = data['smiles']
labels = data['p_np']
y = labels.values

# Step 3: Tokenize SMILES and pad
tokenizer = Tokenizer(char_level=True)
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(smiles_list)
sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(smiles_list)
X_seq = pad_sequences(sequences, padding='post', maxlen=120)
vocab_size = len(tokenizer.word_index) + 1

# Step 4: One-hot encode the sequences
X_onehot = to_categorical(X_seq, num_classes=vocab_size)

# Step 5: Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_onehot, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 6: GRU model without embedding
model = Sequential()
model.add(GRU(units=64, input_shape=(120, vocab_size)))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Step 7: Train and evaluate
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)
loss, acc = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Test Accuracy (One-Hot): {acc:.2f}")
```

---

#### Expected Output

You should see something like:

- One-hot model accuracy: \~76–78%
- Embedding model accuracy: \~79–81%

The embedding model usually performs better due to its ability to learn nuanced relationships between characters and their structural roles.

---

#### Takeaway

- One-hot encoding is simple but limited in chemical expressiveness.
- Learnable embeddings improve generalization, compactness, and structural understanding.
- In molecular property prediction, embeddings are the standard approach for RNN-based models.

### 4.1.4 Challenges of RNNs in Chemistry

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) — especially GRUs and LSTMs — have demonstrated strong performance in SMILES-based molecular property prediction. However, their application in cheminformatics is not without limitations. In this section, we highlight key challenges chemists should consider when using RNNs on molecular data.

---

#### 1. Sensitivity to SMILES Canonicalization

RNNs treat SMILES strings as character sequences. However, the same molecule can be written in multiple valid SMILES formats:

```text
CC(=O)O          # Acetic acid
OC(=O)C          # Acetic acid (non-canonical)
```

**Problem:** The model may fail to generalize across equivalent molecules.

**Solution:** Always canonicalize SMILES using RDKit or similar tools before training to ensure consistency.

---

#### 2. Lack of Structural Awareness

SMILES encodes 2D molecular structure into 1D text. While RNNs can learn syntactic patterns, they do not inherently understand:

- Atom connectivity
- Ring structures
- Branching
- Stereochemistry (unless explicitly encoded)

**Chemist's Insight:** An RNN doesn't "see" a molecule — it reads it like a sentence. Important 3D or topological features may be lost unless explicitly encoded.

---

#### 3. Difficulty Capturing Long-Range Dependencies

In SMILES, chemically related atoms may be far apart in the sequence (e.g., ring closures or branching).

While GRUs and LSTMs help retain memory over longer sequences, they still struggle with non-local dependencies — especially in large molecules or those with fused rings.

---

#### 4. Computational Cost of Sequence Models

RNNs process one token at a time, making them:

- Slower to train than CNNs or Transformers
- More prone to vanishing gradients

For large-scale datasets or high-throughput screening, this can be a bottleneck.

---

#### 5. Limited Interpretability

RNNs lack built-in mechanisms for feature importance, making their predictions harder to interpret.

* Tree-based models offer clearer rationale
* Interpretability tools (e.g., attention, saliency) require additional components

---

#### Summary Table: Pros vs. Cons of RNNs for SMILES

| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Sequence Modeling       | Naturally fits SMILES format         | May miss spatial/graph context                  |
| Memory                  | GRUs/LSTMs capture history           | Struggles with long-range chemical dependencies |

| Interpretability        | Embeds complex relationships         | Requires extra design for explanation           |

---

#### When Should Chemists Use RNNs?

| Recommended When...                     | Avoid When...                              |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| You're working with SMILES-only datasets  | You need graph- or 3D-aware modeling         |
| You want a simple, fast baseline model    | You require interpretability or explanations |
| Your task is classification or regression | Your molecules vary widely in size/branching |
| You have limited computational resources  | You're working with very large datasets      |

### 4.1.5 Embedding Alternatives – Comparing RNNs to Other Sequence Models

While Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) offer a natural way to model SMILES strings, they are no longer the only — or even the best — option for all molecular sequence tasks. In recent years, alternative neural architectures have emerged that outperform RNNs in both speed and accuracy, especially on larger datasets or tasks requiring global context.

This section introduces and compares several popular alternatives to RNNs for learning from molecular sequences.

---

#### 1. 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Originally developed for image processing, 1D CNNs can also handle sequential data by applying filters over fixed-size windows of characters.

**How it works for SMILES:**

- The SMILES sequence is treated as a string of character embeddings.
- Convolutional filters learn substructure patterns (e.g., functional groups) across windows of characters.
- Multiple filters can detect different chemical motifs.

**Advantages:**

- Highly parallelizable — much faster to train than RNNs.
- Effective at learning local patterns in chemical syntax.
- Less prone to vanishing gradients.

**Limitations:**

- Lacks memory of order beyond the convolution window.
- Does not naturally model long-range dependencies or molecule-wide context.

**Chemist's Analogy:** CNNs are like a chemist scanning molecules for familiar substructures — they excel at detecting functional groups, but may miss the big picture.

---

#### 2. Transformers

The Transformer architecture, popularized by models like BERT and GPT, uses self-attention to relate every token to every other token in a sequence — regardless of distance.

**Why Transformers are useful for SMILES:**

- Attention layers can learn interactions between distant atoms in a molecule.
- They are highly parallelizable and scale well with large datasets.
- Pretrained models (like ChemBERTa or SMILES-BERT) can be fine-tuned for new tasks.

**Advantages:**

- State-of-the-art performance on many molecular property prediction tasks.
- Capture global context more effectively than RNNs or CNNs.
- Enable pretraining + fine-tuning workflows for transfer learning.

**Limitations:**

- Require more memory and compute than RNNs or CNNs.
- May need large datasets or pretraining to perform well.

**Chemist's Analogy:** Transformers are like a chemist reading the entire molecule at once, comparing every part with every other — a full-context thinker.

#### 3. Comparison Summary

| Architecture     | Key Strength                                     | Weakness                                 | When to Use                                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| RNN / GRU / LSTM | Good for small/medium SMILES datasets            | Slow training, struggles with long-range | When sequence order matters or datasets are small      |
| 1D CNN           | Fast training, effective local pattern detection | Misses global context                    | When looking for substructure-based patterns           |
| Transformer      | Best global modeling, state-of-the-art accuracy  | Computationally expensive                | For large-scale tasks, or when using pretrained models |

---

#### 4. Choosing the Right Sequence Model in Practice

| If you...                                          | Use this model           |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Want a fast, interpretable baseline                | GRU or LSTM              |
| Are detecting localized substructures (e.g., -OH)  | 1D CNN                   |
| Have large data and want best performance          | Transformer              |
| Are working with resource-constrained environments | GRU with small embedding |

---

#### 5. Looking Ahead

In Chapter 4.2, we’ll explore an alternative that completely steps away from SMILES: **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**. These models work directly on molecular graphs — atoms as nodes, bonds as edges — and naturally capture chemical topology without needing a string format.
