# Section 8: Yield Prediction

Yield prediction in chemistry involves estimating the outcomes of chemical reactions under specific conditions. Modern machine learning methods, including RNNs, GNNs, Random Forests, and Neural Networks, have significantly enhanced yield predictions by capturing complex reaction patterns from experimental data.

## 8.1 Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

### Concept
- RNNs are designed to process sequential data, making them suitable for chemical processes where the reaction conditions evolve over time.  
- They consider past information (previous steps) to predict future outcomes, essential in dynamic chemical systems.

### Example Application
RNNs have been used to model chemical reaction kinetics in continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing, where stable control over complex kinetics is necessary.

### Advantages
- Good at modeling sequences (like reaction progress).  
- Captures temporal dependencies (time-dependent conditions).

### Limitations
- Difficulty in handling long sequences (memory issues).  
- Complex for beginners in terms of mathematical understanding.

### Simple Python Snippet
```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import SimpleRNN, Dense

model = Sequential([
    SimpleRNN(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(10, 1)),
    Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
# model.fit(data, targets)  # data: sequences of reaction conditions
```

## 8.2 Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)

### Concept
- GNNs handle data represented as graphs, perfect for chemical structures (atoms as nodes, bonds as edges).  
- They process molecular structures directly, learning from molecular connectivity.

### Example Application
Predicting chemical reaction yields by learning directly from molecular graphs to understand how specific chemical structures influence outcomes.

### Advantages
- Directly applicable to chemical structures.  
- Strong at capturing relationships and interactions in molecules.

### Limitations
- Require substantial amounts of structured molecular data.  
- Mathematical complexity might be high for beginners.

### Simple Python Snippet
```python
import torch
from torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv
import torch.nn.functional as F

class GNN(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(GNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = GCNConv(10, 16)
        self.conv2 = GCNConv(16, 1)

    def forward(self, data):
        x, edge_index = data.x, data.edge_index
        x = F.relu(self.conv1(x, edge_index))
        x = self.conv2(x, edge_index)
        return x

# Example usage would involve molecular graph data
```

## 8.3 Random Forests

### Concept
Random Forests are ensemble methods combining multiple decision trees. They aggregate predictions from various decision trees to enhance accuracy and reduce overfitting.

### Example Application
Successfully predicted yields for chemical synthesis reactions such as pyrroles and dipyrromethanes, highlighting how different reagents affect reaction outcomes.

### Advantages
- Intuitive and easy to implement.  
- Good accuracy and robustness with noisy data.

### Limitations
- Less effective with extremely large datasets.  
- Interpretability can decrease with increasing complexity.

### Simple Python Snippet
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

rf_model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
# rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)  # X_train: reaction conditions, y_train: reaction yields
# yield_prediction = rf_model.predict(X_test)
```

## 8.4 Neural Networks

### Concept
Neural networks mimic biological neurons and connections, capable of capturing nonlinear and complex relationships. They typically consist of input layers, hidden layers, and output layers.

### Example Application
Used broadly to predict chemical reaction outcomes, learning from experimental data to forecast yields even for reactions with complex mechanisms.

### Advantages
- Powerful in modeling complex, nonlinear relationships.  
- Flexible architectures applicable to various chemical prediction tasks.

### Limitations
- Requires significant computational resources.  
- Needs large datasets for effective training.

### Simple Python Snippet
```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

nn_model = Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_size,)),
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1)  # yield prediction
])

nn_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
# nn_model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50)
```
