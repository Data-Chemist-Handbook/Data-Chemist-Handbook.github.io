# Section 10. LLMs for Chemistry

- **Brief Introduction**
    
    Large Language Models, or LLMs, are advanced machine learning models capable of understanding and generating human-like text and answering QA questions based on extensive training data from diverse sources.
    
    In chemistry, these models assist researchers and students by automating information retrieval, predicting chemical reactions, and supporting molecular design tasks. Benchmarks such as ChemLLMBench provide datasets to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of LLMs in chemical contexts.
    
    So what exactly are LLMs and why are they so powerful?  We will dive into this in this section.
    
- **10.1 Introduction of LLMs**
    
    **What are LLMs?**
    
    - Large Language Models (LLMs) are smart computer systems like ChatGPT and Gemini. They learn from huge amounts of text data and can understand and generate human-like writing.
    
    **What can they do?**
    
    - These AI models can understand the meaning behind words, answer questions, and even come up with new ideas.
    - In chemistry, LLMs are helpful because they can:
        - Simplify complicated chemical information.
        - Make difficult tasks easier to handle.
        - Quickly find and organize important data.
        - Help automate tasks that might otherwise take scientists a long time to complete.
        - Summarizing extensive research articles or reports succinctly.
    
    In short, LLMs help make complex information clearer and easier to work with, even if you don't have a chemistry background. 
    
    ‚Üí Such applications can substantially speed up research processes, improve accuracy, and open new avenues for innovative scientific discoveries.
    
- **10.2 Prompt Engineering**
    
    **Definition:**
    Prompt engineering involves carefully writing instructions (prompts) to guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to give accurate and useful answers. In simpler terms, it's how you ask questions or provide information to an AI system clearly and specifically.
    
    **Why is it important in chemistry?**
    Chemists often ask AI models to help with complex tasks, such as predicting chemical reactions or interpreting experimental data. Clear and detailed prompts help the AI understand exactly what information you're looking for
    
    - **Format of a Good Prompt:**
    A well-structured prompt typically contains these key parts:
        - **General Instruction:** Briefly describes the task context or role the model is expected to perform.
            - Example: *"You are an expert chemist. Given the [**Input Representation**]: [**Input Data**], predict the [**Target Output**] using your expert-level knowledge in [**Relevant Domain**].[**Input Explanation** ].[**Output Explanation and Restriction**].[**Few shot prompt**]"*
            - **Input Representation:**  The form or type of input being provided to the model (e.g., SMILES, molecular description, text, structure image).
                - Example: *" ‚ÄúSMILES string‚Äù, ‚Äúmolecular structure‚Äù, ‚Äúchemical formula‚Äù, ‚Äúcompound name‚Äù "*
            - **Input Data:**  The actual instance of input that the model will work with ‚Äî this is the specific data for the task.
                - Example: *" ‚ÄúCC(=O)OC1=CC=CC=C1C(=O)O‚Äù (Aspirin), or ‚Äúbenzene + nitric acid"*
            - **Target Output:**  The expected prediction or result that the model should generate based on the input.
                - Example: *" ‚Äúproduct SMILES‚Äù, ‚Äúreaction outcome‚Äù, ‚Äúgenerated molecule‚Äù*
            - **Relevant Domain:** The specific area of chemical expertise the model should rely on to solve the task.
                - Example: *" ‚Äúorganic chemistry‚Äù, ‚Äúreaction prediction‚Äù, ‚Äúmolecular design‚Äù, ‚Äúdrug discovery‚Äù*
            - **Input Explanation:** Specifies the data or information provided.
                - Example: *"Given the reactants aspirin and hydrochloric acid..."*
            - **Output Explanation and Restrictions:** Clearly describes the format and type of response desired, with any limitations.
                - Example: *"Provide the reaction products in SMILES notation only, without additional explanations."*
            - **Few shot prompt:** Few-shot prompting involves providing examples of similar problems and solutions within your prompt. This helps the model understand precisely what is expected by learning from these given examples.
                - **Example of Few-shot Prompt:**
                    - Input: *"Reactants: aspirin + hydrochloric acid. Products (SMILES): xxxx"*
                    - Output: *"[Exact product SMILES]"*
                    - Input: *"Reactants: benzene + nitric acid. Products (SMILES): xxxx"*
                    - Output: *"[Exact product SMILES]"*
    
    **Example of Prompt Engineering:**
    
    *Task: Analyze the interaction between hydrogen gas and water.*
    
    "You are an expert in chemist. I am exploring basic chemical interactions and need a detailed explanation of what happens when hydrogen gas (H‚ÇÇ) is introduced to water (H‚ÇÇO) under standard conditions. Using your experienced chemical  knowledge please describe:
    
    - The physical and chemical properties of hydrogen in water,
    - Any possible reactions or interactions (if any) between hydrogen and water,
    - The conditions under which a reaction might occur,
    - Potential energy changes or hazards involved, and
    - Why the reaction does or does not proceed under normal conditions.
    
    Provide clear explanations and any relevant safety considerations."
    
    - **Tips for effective prompt engineering:**
        - **Clarity:** Always be specific and clear.
        - **Context:** Provide important details like chemical names, reaction conditions, or experimental setup.
        - **Structured Requests:** Clearly state what kind of response you expect (e.g., chemical structure, explanation, prediction).
        - **Examples:** Sometimes providing examples (known as few-shot prompting) can help the model understand the desired answer format better.
    
- **10.3 Usage of LLM APIs**
     
    Chemists can utilize APIs provided by popular LLM platforms such as OpenAI, Google, and other AI providers. Using APIs, chemists can:
    
    - Embed intelligent text-based query capabilities directly into their chemical informatics software or laboratory information management systems.
    - Automate literature review tasks, identifying relevant publications, extracting pertinent data, and summarizing extensive research quickly and accurately.
    - Create custom interfaces or dashboards where chemical data can be analyzed interactively by leveraging AI-generated insights from LLM APIs.
    
    For example, OpenAI provides straightforward documentation to help developers and chemists implement their APIs into software, facilitating rapid adoption.

    print("Path to dataset files:", path)
    # 1. Read the CSV file into a DataFrame
    df = pd.read_csv(path+'/BBBP.csv')
    df.head()
    ```
    ### If the data is not in the kaggle hub
    ```python 
    import requests
    import os

    # Create a folder to store the file
    os.makedirs("data", exist_ok=True)

    # URL to the file (example: CSV file hosted online)
    url = "URL_TO_THE_FILE"
    file_path = "Path_To_The_File" #Where you want to store the file to

    # Download the file
    response = requests.get(url)
    with open(file_path, "wb") as f:
        f.write(response.content)

    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    df.head()

    ```
    ##  5. Make an OpenAI API Call
    ```python
    from openai import OpenAI
    # Creat model
    client = OpenAI()
    sample_data = df.to_csv(index=False)
    prompt = f"""PUT YOUR QUESTION AND PROMPT AT HERE. Here is the data File that you
    can reference {sample_data}"""
    # Function to call when you want to ask something
    completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert chemist. Response in Markdown format"},
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": [{"type":"text","text": prompt}]
            }
        ],
        temperature=1,
        max_tokens=1000,
        top_p =1,
    )
    ```
    
    ###  6. Evaluate the Model's Output
    
    ```python
    def similarity_score(expected, answer):
        expected_lower = expected.lower()
        answer_lower = answer.lower()
        return 1 if expected_lower == answer_lower else 0
    
    ```
